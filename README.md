# 635_final_project: Tiny RPG

We designed and implemented a Tiny RPG game as our final project topic.

Our aim is to showcase the underlying logic of an RPG game through this small demo. The game will obtain player input from the keyboard and print the current game state onto the terminal.

After that, we plan to design and implement a GUI interface for Tiny RPG and enrich the game with NPCs, maps, gameplay, and other feature elements in this game.

We hope you'll enjoy it.

## Gameplay

Players can use `W, A, S, D` keys to move on the game map.

Each game starts with a randomly generated game map.

> You will meet different elements while moving on the game map:
>
> 🚶: Player  
> 👹: Monster  
> ⬛: Obstacle  
> 🏁: Destination  
> ⬜: Empty space  
> ❤️: Healing tile  
> 💪: Attack power-up tile  
> ❓: Chance tile
